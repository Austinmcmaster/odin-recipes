# odin-recipes
This is going to demonstracte the beginning of my HTML skills. This project will be about recipes. It will connect multiple websites together and show my basic skills. 

This project reviewed my basic boiler plate skills, links, list of unordered or ordered perspectivly. It also allowed me to integrate images in such.
It was fun but, a little repetative to do since it was 3 duplicated pages practically but, still an introduction to web development.

Though it was fun looking at some of my favorite foods and I hope that I can have those again soon.

This project simply is to make a sight that connects to recipes that are my favorite and they also give instruction on how to recreate them. Though some of the ones I chose were self explanatory.

Overall a fun project, lets get to some CSS.
Testing Stuff!
Lets get to work!
