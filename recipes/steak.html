        <h2>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This recipe is quite simple. We have a combination of small baked potatoes which are sautted a little after
                to give a nice crunchy texture. We have asparagus associated with salt and butter boiled. Then we have a beautiful ribye which is cooked to 
                a beatiful medium rare color. Flavored with thyme, salt and pepper, butter. Wondrous meal.
